Cognizant has been under fire recently for hiring senior-level employees from rival companies. Rival Wipro has filed lawsuits against at least two of Cognizant employees including Cognizant’s current chief financial officer Jatin Dalal (former Wipro CFO) who joined in December. Meanwhile, Infosys has alleged Cognizant of using “unethical poaching tactics” in a communication likely directed at CEO Ravi Kumar, who was formerly Infosys president.
